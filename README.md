# Spotify-Clone
This is a Clone of popular music streaming website Spotify completed as an independent project. The website is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 


### Summary

This file has only one webpage, index.html. Css, js, images, and songs files are stored in their respective files. The webpage is designed to mimic the original website, so some features are purely aesthetic and do not serve any purpose.

The js reads all the files in the songs directory, each file in songs directory has a cover image, .json file, and .mp3 songs. After reading the file, the scripts load all the album in the right container on the screen and all the songs in the first songs file in the songs directory in the left container on the screen.
